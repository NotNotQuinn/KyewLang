```
📁 lexer            -=-   Lexing (translating/recognising) text into tokens that the parser can understand
📁 parser           -=-   Parsing the tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (A.S.T.) that has order of operations
📁 custom           -=-   Things like in-lang syntax errors, token definitions, etc.
📝 math-lang.ts     -=-   Exposing API for using the language
📝 interactive.ts   -=-   Simple implementation of API in math-lang.ts
```
