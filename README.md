# KyewLang

A simple language you can perform calculations in.
Currently the execution step is in a scuffed form, but it does calculate.

Language name subject to change.

## Syntax

Syntax subject to change, see grammer.md for a technical 
breakdown of how tokens are parsed, here is an overview:

It can do basic calculations like addition, subtraction, 
multiplication and division.
```txt
"1 + 1" -> 2
"1 + 2 * 3" -> 7
```
Thats it for now, but I have a few things planned. 

For example:
```
"(1 + 2) * 3" -> 9
```
Things I dont know what the syntax for yet are in grammer.md.
